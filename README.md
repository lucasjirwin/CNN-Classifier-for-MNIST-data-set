# CNN-Classifier-for-MNIST-data-set

In this project I train both a Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFNN) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the MNIST training data using PyTorch and compare their performance on the test data. I achieve 98.10% accuracy with the FFNN and 99.08% with the CNN (close to human-level classification performance!).
